# QuantumSchrodingerEquation

A quantum simulation of a single-particle Schrodinger Equation. Here I present a Jupyter notebook with the steps to perform a quantum simulation using Qiskit. 
The work presented in this notebook is inspired by the paper [Quantum simulation of the single-particle Schr√∂dinger
equation](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/76/7/657/1038339/Quantum-simulation-of-the-single-particle).
